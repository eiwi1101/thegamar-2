  name "Vincent the Strange"

  description <<-DESC
    A tall man, clad in solid black robes that trail to the floor, obscuring most of his form. 
    His head is covered in a hood that conceals his face, though every now and then you could 
    swear something moved under there. His voice is sweet as pie when he speaks to you though!
